# Appsec Fundamentals Secret Scanning

A 4-hour workshop exploring scanning for secrets in code and containers.

As developers, we know that secrets like passwords, API keys, and access tokens are critical to our work. But what happens when these secrets accidentally end up in our code, logs or error messages? In this AppSec Fundamentals workshop we aim to explore this challenge, how to mitigate the risks and what to do when we have messed up. We will also explore some good practices for managing secrets in our development environments.

This will be a hands-on workshop where you'll walk away with practical solution you can start using right away. Context matters - so fire up your curiosity, be prepared to explore and ask question - and join us.
